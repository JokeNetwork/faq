## <span class="badge bg-danger">Unsupported</span> Meta-Tag apple-mobile-web-app-capable

The apple-mobile-web-app-capable metatag defines wether a website/webapp which was added to the homescreen can run in fullscreen or not.

Apparently this does not work anymore and is therefor marked as <span class="badge bg-danger">Unsupported</span>.

Read more about Apple's Webapps at [Apple's official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/appleapplications/reference/SafariHTMLRef/Articles/MetaTags.html).

### Usage:

	<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">

`content` can also be `false`, but the meta-tag is obsolete then.
