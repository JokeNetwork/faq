# JokeNetwork FAQ

Welcome to JokeNetworks Documentation page ðŸ¥³

Here you can find and contribute to the source-code of our FAQ-page, which is publicly available at https://faq.jokenetwork.de.

## What is this about?

In our documentation anyone can find public docs ~~for our (deprecated) services (which aren't important for that matter) and also~~ **docs for the W3 WHATWG community** ([the MetaExtensions part of WhatWG](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions)).

The "faq" page with questions answered, that weren't asked frequently, was created in January 2014, when [@philipbrembeck](https://github.com/philipbrembeck) was in need of creating a new HTML MetaExtension, which would not be marked as an error in the W3 Validator.

## Contribute
If you want to contribute, just create a new docs under `source` with `<title of your page>.md`. Don't forget to add it to the `index.md` too! 
Then just open a pull request and we'll review your page and add it.
