# JokeNetwork FAQ

Welcome to JokeNetworks Documentation page ðŸ¥³
Here you can find and contribute to the source-code of our FAQ-page, which is publicly available at https://faq.jokenetwork.de.

## What is this about?

In our documentation anyone can find public docs ~~for our (deprecated) services (which aren't important for that matter) and also~~ **docs for the W3 WHATWG community** ([the MetaExtensions part of WhatWG](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions))!

The "faq" page with questions answered, that weren't asked frequently, was created in January 2014, when [@philipbrembeck](https://github.com/philipbrembeck) was in need of creating a new HTML MetaExtension, which would also not be marked up as an error in the W3 Validator.
